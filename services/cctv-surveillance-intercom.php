                                <p class="content">Verbum Surveillance NVR systems use Power-over-Ethernet technology to simplify system setup. Our HD IP cameras use a single network cable for video, audio, power and PTZ control.

Our NVRs enable remote viewing from a smartphone, tablet, or PC over the Internet or a local network.</p>

                                <p class="content">Our standalone WiFi cameras are a reliable alternative to wired security camera systems for customers looking to avoid having to run cabling. They are great for a home or business where it is either impossible or cost prohibitive to run security camera cabling. However, wireless cameras still require power from either a 110V AC power outlet or solar panel for continuous operation. WiFi cameras are cameras which connect wirelessly to your wifi Modem or Router, then stream footage to a smartphone application. That way, you can boost your business or home’s security, or install a simple way to keep an eye on your children.</p>

                                <p>Our WiFi cameras come equipped with 100ft of night vision to see in complete darkness, and remote viewing capabilities from a computer, smartphone, or tablet when internet is available at the system location.</p>
